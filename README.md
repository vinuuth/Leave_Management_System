Leave Management System. 
Project Overview:
Developed a comprehensive Employee Leave Management System designed to streamline the process of tracking and managing employee leave records within the organization. The system aimed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of leave management while ensuring ease of use for both employees and administrators.

Key Responsibilities and Achievements:

System Design and Implementation:
Utilized Java for backend development to create a robust application that handles various leave types, including sick leave, vacation, and personal leave. Integrated MySQL as the database management system to store and manage employee leave data securely.

User-Friendly Interface:
Designed and implemented an intuitive user interface that simplifies navigation for users, allowing employees to easily apply for leave, check leave balances, and view their leave history. This interface improved user engagement and reduced the time spent on administrative tasks.

Data Organization and Accessibility:
Enhanced data organization through the use of structured database tables and relationships, enabling quick retrieval of employee leave records. Implemented features for filtering and sorting leave requests to improve accessibility for HR personnel.

Testing and Quality Assurance:
Conducted thorough testing of the application to identify and resolve any bugs or performance issues. Gathered user feedback to refine functionalities and ensure the system met the needs of both employees and management.

A JavaFX based web application used for leave management which can be used by the corporate companies.Employees can request time off through a leave
management system, and managers can approve those requests. The amount of leave time
that employees might take was formerly manually recorded on sheets of paper. So, the main
agenda of this project is to automate the leave management system of an organization and to
maintain the leave records of all the employees in that organization.
