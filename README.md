 A JavaFX based web application used for leave management which can be used by the corporate companies.Employees can request time off through a leave
management system, and managers can approve those requests. The amount of leave time
that employees might take was formerly manually recorded on sheets of paper. So, the main
agenda of this project is to automate the leave management system of an organization and to
maintain the leave records of all the employees in that organization.
